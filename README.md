# SystemAnalysis-Design

Project Summary

The DriverPass Project was developed for a client named Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company focused on improving driver training and helping students pass their DMV tests. The client wanted a system that would allow users to:
Access online driver’s education courses and practice tests
Schedule and manage in-person driving lessons
Assign specific drivers and vehicles to appointments
Provide administrative control for different employee roles (IT officer, secretary, etc.)
Maintain secure access, activity tracking, and integration with DMV updates
The system needed to be web-based, accessible from multiple devices, and secure. It also required the flexibility to manage various lesson packages, handle customer data, and produce reports for management oversight.

Reflection
What I Did Well
One of the parts I’m most proud of in this project was creating the UML diagrams—including the use case, activity, and sequence diagrams. Before this class, I had never worked with UML or formal system design tools, so learning how to build and interpret these diagrams was a big accomplishment. They helped me visualize how users would interact with the system and how the processes connected from start to finish.
What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I would spend more time refining the diagrams to include more detailed interactions and relationships. I feel like I only scratched the surface of what UML can do, and with more time, I could have created a more comprehensive representation of the system’s flow and logic.
Interpreting User Needs
I carefully analyzed the client interview transcript to extract both functional and non-functional requirements. For example, Liam needed a way for customers to make reservations online, while his IT officer needed full access control to manage accounts. Understanding these user roles helped me structure the system’s permissions, workflows, and overall design.
Considering the user’s needs is vital—it ensures that the system actually addresses real-world problems and provides a user-friendly experience for everyone who interacts with it.
My Approach to System Design
When designing software, I focus on understanding who the users are and what problems they need solved. I start by creating diagrams to map out processes and relationships before moving into detailed design or implementation. Going forward, I plan to continue using UML tools and expand into techniques like user stories, wireframes, and prototyping to strengthen my analysis and design process.

Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned how to translate client requirements into visual system models that communicate both functionality and structure. I gained confidence in using UML as a planning tool and developed a stronger appreciation for the importance of requirement gathering, documentation, and design consistency in software development.
